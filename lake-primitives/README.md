# NEAR Lake Primitives

NEAR Lake Primitives is a Rust crate that provides a set of high-level primitives specifically designed for the NEAR Lake Framework. It is part of the effort to streamline and facilitate the development of blockchain applications within the NEAR ecosystem.

## Features

The crate offers a range of fundamental primitives, or basic components, that developers can use to build more complex structures and processes within the NEAR Lake Framework. These primitives are optimized for efficient computation and robust interoperability.

## Usage

To use the NEAR Lake Primitives in your Rust project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
near_lake_primitives = "0.8.0"
```

You can then import the crate in your code as follows:

```rust
use near_lake_primitives;
```

## Examples
